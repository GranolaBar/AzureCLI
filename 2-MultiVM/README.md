# Running multiple VMs on Azure for scalability and availability

## Description
This configuration is meant for running multiple instances with the same VM image.  The intended scenario is a single-tier app, such as a stateless web app or storage cluster, using multiple instances for scalability and availability.  Multi-tier applications are not included.

In this architecture, the workload is distributed across the VM instances. There is a single public IP address, and Internet traffic is distributed to the VMs using a load balancer. This architecture can be used for a single-tier app, such as a stateless web app or storage cluster. It is also a building block for N-tier applications.
